# Constraints

The Constraints are used for specfying a set of conditions while genearting the sequences. The constraints help in verfying the design for Random verfication of the DUT. 
The Constrained Random Verfication is much better than normal directed Verification. The sequences help in catching the bugs or unintentional errors that cause functionality error.
